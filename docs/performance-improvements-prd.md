# NostalgiaForInfinityX6 Performance Improvements PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis

#### Current Project State
NostalgiaForInfinityX6 is an advanced, single-file algorithmic trading strategy for the Freqtrade platform. The strategy is organized within a single large file (approximately 60,000 lines) with approximately 800 lines of configuration parameters and complex trading logic. The strategy supports both spot and futures markets and features a multi-layered system of trading modes.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- [x] Performance/Scalability Improvements

#### Enhancement Description
Analysis of the current performance status of the NostalgiaForInfinityX6 strategy and presentation of concrete proposals for performance improvements. Specifically, modularizing the monolithic structure and reducing CPU intensity are targeted.

#### Impact Assessment
- [x] Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Identify current performance issues of the strategy
- Present concrete proposals for performance improvements
- Modularize the monolithic structure
- Optimize CPU and memory usage

#### Background Context
NostalgiaForInfinityX6 is a highly complex algorithmic trading strategy developed for the Freqtrade platform. The strategy causes CPU intensity by calculating a large number of technical indicators on every candle. In addition, the monolithic structure makes it difficult to understand and optimize the code. This PRD aims to define the improvements needed to increase the performance of the strategy and make the structure more sustainable.
